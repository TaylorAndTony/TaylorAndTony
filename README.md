👋 Hi, I’m @TaylorAndTony, an amateur developer who isn't in computer major.

👀 Interested in Python, C# desktop gui, and I combine them with my major.

🚀 JavaScript can help me in my daily, boring jobs.

🔶 I like Animes, so there will be some anime-style in my softwares.

🎮 Open world games such as Minecraft, Noita, are attractive to me.
