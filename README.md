👋 Hi, I’m @TaylorAndTony

👀 I’m interested in Python and other cool stuff.

🔶 I like watching Anime such as Re: zero and there will be some anime-style in my softwares.

🎬 I also like video editing and photo editing, Premiere Pro and Photoshop are awesome tools for me.

📷 Photography is charming, and I am interested in combining that with algorithms.

🎮 Minecraft, Titanfall 2, Noita and Genshin Impact are the games I like.
